# To Do

## Code

- Static typing.
- Do not hardcode the number of bits.
- Handle energy (currently it's not taken into account).
- Add/handle events other than the goals.
  - bug
  - error rb
  - error rc
  - error rd
  - error not
  - error rol
  - error xor
  - ok
  - reset ra
  - reset rb
  - reset rc
  - reset rd
  - reset 2
  - reset 4
  - reset 8
- Use custom classes based on `TextureRect` and `TextureButton`, instead of calling `_TextureRect_setup` and `_TextureButton_setup`.

## Interface

- Make the whole registry be a button (the label and all the bits), not only the label.
- Adjust spacing and scaling to better use the screen.
- Add banner/title.
