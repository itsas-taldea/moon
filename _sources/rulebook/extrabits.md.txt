# Extra bits

MOONâ€™s modular design allows you to **expand** the number of bits in its CPU, substantially increasing the complexity of
the game.

The base game comes with **8 extra bits** to extend the registers `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` to 5 bits or 6 bits.

Since goal cards only contain 4-bit combinations, we will need **two goal cards** to indicate the 5-bit or 6-bit
combinations to be solved.

In **cooperative** mode, we will draw two goal cards when solving a goal:

- You solve a goal
- You show the following goal.
- At the end of the round, you draw one goal card.

The goal will be made up of all the **rightmost** bits of the two goal cards.
For example, playing with registers of 6 bits, the goal will comprise the 4 bits of the card on the right and the 2
rightmost bits of the card on the left:

In **competitive** mode, you will put each part of the goal to **each side** of your RAM module to avoid mixing them.
