> MOON is an educational game where players will simulate a simple computer.
> Help the astronauts to fulfill their mission!

This repository contains an open source videogame implementation of [MOON](https://compus.deusto.es/moon/) using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/),
along with the rulebook and documentation in HTML using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).

Other videogame implementations of MOON exist; however, as far as we are aware, those are not open source (yet) or being
actively developed/maintained in a public repository (at the moment):

- These are all different versions of the same implementation based on [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/):
  - [moon.deusto.es](https://moon.deusto.es/)
  - An `.apk` for Android can be downloaded from [compus.deusto.es/moon](https://compus.deusto.es/moon/).
  - [play.google.com: MOON board game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.deusto.moon)
- [tabletopia.com/games/moon](https://tabletopia.com/games/moon)

Therefore, the purpose of this repository is to provide a foundation for (computer science and engineering) students,
hobbyists and software developers to learn and practice by exploring the features and extensions of MOON not available
in existing implementations.
For instance: increasing the number of bits, more error events, a portrait layout for smartphones, adding multiplayer
support, or including the LUNA computer.

At the same time, it is a showcase of how easy it is to [continuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
create, build and release 2D and/or 3D [games, apps or tools](https://godotengine.org/showcase/) for desktop, mobile and
web using free and open source tools (Godot and [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) containers);
as long as the assets and logic are designed beforehand!

The development/contribution approach in this repository is to commit early and push often.
Should you find any issue or if you are willing to contribute, [let us know](https://github.com/itsas-taldea/moon/issues)!
